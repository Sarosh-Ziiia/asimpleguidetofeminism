    <h1 style="padding-top: 10px;"> What does feminism mean for us </h1>
    <div id="def">
    <p> Today, <strong> feminism </strong> exists as a means to end gender-specific oppression in all
    aspects of life. It serves as a voice for all abused women who have been made victims of
    patriarchy, be it social, domestic, or political. It exists as a movement to celebrate solidarity
    among women who have endured unimaginable trauma on the mere basis of their sex. Women
    who have had their autonomy stolen from them by men who justify it with a delusion of
    entitlement based on their sex.<br> With a global count of <em> 15 million  adolescent girls </em> falling victim
    to sexual violence and <em> 16 million girls </em> married before their eighteenth birthday, it becomes a
    matter of pity that, after decades of innovation, global organizations and political parties have
    failed to act on this matter with the urgency it requires and deserves. Feminism becomes exactly what this world requires when we absorb the extent of
    gender inequality that prevails unaccounted for in our daily lives. <br> Without feminism, women
    today would be living without the fundamental right to vote. With the severe magnitude of
    victim blaming and rape culture, extensive underrepresentation of women across all political
    forums, and a significant wage gap existing on the mere basis of sex, feminism becomes
    nothing short of a necessity in the modern world. </p> <br>

    <h1 id="histo"> Brief history </h1>
    <p> In the pages of history, the journey of feminism unfolds as a resounding anthem of resilience and liberation. From the suffragettes who fought for the right to vote, to the trailblazing feminists who shattered glass ceilings and blazed trails in every realm of human endeavor, the narrative of feminism echoes with the power of change.
        <br>
        It emerged from the depths of oppression and discrimination, a response to the pervasive belief that women were lesser, voiceless, and confined to narrow roles. Brave women and enlightened allies challenged the status quo, embarking on a courageous quest to dismantle the shackles that bound them.
        <br>
        With unwavering determination, feminists united, demanding equal rights, autonomy, and agency over their bodies and lives. They faced backlash, ridicule, and resistance, but their spirit could not be extinguished. Rallying around the core principle of equality, they forged alliances, created powerful movements, and paved the way for generations to come.
        <br>
        Feminism ignited a revolution in the hearts and minds of people worldwide. It sparked conversations, shattered stereotypes, and unearthed the deep-rooted biases that hindered progress. Through impassioned speeches, compelling literature, and unyielding activism, feminists propelled society forward, carving a path towards a more just and inclusive world.
        <br>
        In the relentless pursuit of gender equity, feminists fought for reproductive rights, economic empowerment, and an end to gender-based violence. They championed intersectionality, recognizing that the experiences of women intersect with race, class, sexuality, and more, making their struggle a tapestry woven with myriad threads of inequality.
        <br>
        Today, feminism continues to evolve, embracing diverse voices and confronting new challenges.It embraces the power of solidarity, as people of all genders unite to dismantle patriarchal systems and create a future free from discrimination and oppression.
        <br>
        The empowering history of feminism teaches us that change is possible, that our collective voice can break barriers, and that equality is not a distant dream but a tangible reality within our grasp. Let us honor the legacy of those who came before us, and with every step forward, carve a brighter path for future generations, where the power and potential of every individual, regardless of gender, can shine unencumbered. </p>
    <blockquote>
        “We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller. We say to girls, you can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful, but not too successful. Otherwise, you would threaten the man. Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important. Now marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don’t teach boys the same? We raise girls to see each other as competitors not for jobs or accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, but for the attention of men. We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are.”
